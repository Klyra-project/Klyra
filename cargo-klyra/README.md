<a id="subcommands">
<h1>Subcommands</h1>
</a>

`cargo-klyra`'s subcommands help you build and deploy web apps from start to finish.

Run `cargo-klyra --help` to see the basic usage:

```
USAGE:
    cargo-klyra [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --api-url <api-url>
            Run this command against the api at the supplied url [env: klyra_API=]

        --name <name>                              Specify the name of the project (overrides crate name)
        --working-directory <working-directory>    Specify the working directory [default: .]

SUBCOMMANDS:
    auth      create user credentials for the klyra platform
    delete    delete the latest deployment for a klyra project
    deploy    deploy a klyra project
    help      Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)
    init      create a new klyra project
    login     login to the klyra platform
    logs      view the logs of a klyra project
    run       run a klyra project locally
    status    view the status of a klyra project
```

### Subcommand: `init`

To initialize a klyra project with boilerplates, run `cargo klyra init [OPTIONS] [PATH]`. 

Currently, `cargo klyra init` supports the following frameworks:

- `--axum`: for [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) framework
- `--poem`: for [poem](https://github.com/poem-web/poem) framework
- `--rocket`: for [rocket](https://rocket.rs/) framework
- `--tide`: for [tide](https://github.com/http-rs/tide) framework
- `--tower`: for [tower](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower) library

For example, running the following command will initialize a project for [rocket](https://rocket.rs/):

```sh
$ cargo klyra init --rocket my-rocket-app
```

This should generate the following dependency in `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
klyra-service = { version = "0.5.0", features = ["web-rocket"] }
```

The following boilerplate code should be generated into `src/lib.rs`:

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate rocket;

use klyra_service::KlyraRocket;

#[get("/hello")]
fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[klyra_service::main]
async fn init() -> KlyraRocket {
    let rocket = rocket::build().mount("/", routes![hello]);

    Ok(rocket)
}
```

### Subcommand: `run`

To run the klyra project locally, use the following command:

```sh
# Inside your klyra project
$ cargo klyra run
```

This will compile your klyra project and start it on the default port `8000`. Test it by:

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:8000/hello
Hello, world!
```

### Subcommand: `login`

Use `cargo klyra login` inside your klyra project to generate an API key for the klyra platform:

```sh
# Inside a klyra project
$ cargo klyra login
```

This should automatically open a browser window with an auto-generated API key for your project. Simply copy-paste the API key back in your terminal or run the following command to complete login:

```sh
$ cargo klyra login --api-key your-api-key-from-browser
```

### Subcommand: `deploy`

To deploy your klyra project to the cloud, run:

```sh
$ cargo klyra deploy
```

Your service will immediately be available at `{crate_name}.klyraapp.rs`. For instance:

```sh
$ curl https://my-rocket-app.klyraapp.rs/hello
Hello, world!
```

### Subcommand: `status`

Check the status of your deployed klyra project with:

```sh
$ cargo klyra status
```

### Subcommand: `logs`

Check the logs of your deployed klyra project with:

```sh
$ cargo klyra logs
```

### Subcommand: `auth`

Run the following to create user credentials for klyra platform:

```sh
$ cargo klyra auth your-desired-username
```

### Subcommand: `delete`

Once you are done with a deployment, you can delete it by running:

```sh
$ cargo klyra delete
```

<h1>Development</h1>

Thanks for using `cargo-klyra`! Weâ€™re very happy to have you with us!

During our alpha period, API keys are completely free and you can deploy as many services as you want.

Just keep in mind that there may be some kinks that require us to take all deployments down once in a while. In certain circumstances we may also have to delete all the data associated with those deployments.

To contribute to `cargo-klyra` or stay updated with our development, please [open an issue, discussion or PR on Github](https://github.com/klyra-hq/klyra) and [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/H33rRDTm3p)! ðŸš€
