# Klyra

[Klyra](https://www.klyra.rs/) is a Rust-native cloud development platform that lets you deploy your Rust apps for free.

Klyra is built for productivity, reliability and performance:

- Zero-Configuration support for Rust using annotations
- Automatic resource provisioning (databases, caches, subdomains, etc.) via [Infrastructure-From-Code](https://www.klyra.rs/blog/2022/05/09/ifc)
- First-class support for popular Rust frameworks ([Actix Web](https://docs.klyra.rs/examples/actix), [Rocket](https://docs.klyra.rs/examples/rocket), [Axum](https://docs.klyra.rs/examples/axum), and [more](https://docs.klyra.rs/examples/other))
- Support for deploying Discord bots using [Serenity](https://docs.klyra.rs/examples/serenity)
- Scalable hosting (with optional self-hosting in the future)

üìñ Check out our documentation to get started quickly: [docs.klyra.rs](https://docs.klyra.rs)

üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è If you have any questions, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/klyra) server.

## (NEW) Klyra Console

Your projects can now be viewed on the brand new [Klyra Console](https://console.klyra.rs/)!
The CLI is still used for most tasks.

![console-preview](https://i.imgur.com/1qdWipP.gif)
*The GIF above visualizes the ease of adding resources to your project(s), along with how they are displayed in the console.*

## Getting Started

The `cargo-klyra` CLI can be installed with a pre-built binary or from source with cargo.

Klyra provides pre-built binaries of the `cargo-klyra` CLI with every release
for most platforms, they can be found on [our GitHub](https://github.com/klyra-hq/klyra/releases/latest).

Our binaries can also be installed using [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall),
which will automatically install the correct target for your system.
To install with `cargo-binstall`, run:

```sh
# cargo-binstall can also be installed directly as a binary to skip the compilation time: https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall#installation
cargo install cargo-binstall
cargo binstall cargo-klyra
# If installing binstall or cargo-klyra fails, try adding `--locked` to the install command
```

Although a bit slower, you can also install directly with cargo:

```sh
cargo install cargo-klyra
```

After installing, log in with:

```sh
cargo klyra login
```

To initialize your project, simply write:

```bash
cargo klyra init --template axum hello-world
# Choose a unique project name!
```

And to deploy it, write:

```bash
cd hello-world
cargo klyra project start  # Only needed if project has not already been created during init
cargo klyra deploy --allow-dirty
```

And... that's it!

```text
Service Name:  hello-world
Deployment ID: 3d08ac34-ad63-41c1-836b-99afdc90af9f
Status:        running
Last Updated:  2022-04-01T08:32:34Z
URI:           https://hello-world.klyraapp.rs
```

Feel free to build on top of the generated `hello-world` boilerplate or take a stab at one of our [examples](https://github.com/klyra-hq/klyra-examples).
